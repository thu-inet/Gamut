GAMUT's Documentation (v0.3.0)
=================================

Welcome to GAMUT! GAMUT (GAMma UTils) is an open-source Python framework for gamma
spectrum analysis.

Equipped with the object-oriented feature, modular design, and pipeline combination capacity,
GAMUT is designed to be an accurate and extensible alternative for gamma spectrum analysis,
as well as a platform to implement various gamma spectrum analysis algorithms.

GAMUT is now at 0.3.0 version, and more features are under active development. Any trial or
secondary development on GAMUT are welcomed!
