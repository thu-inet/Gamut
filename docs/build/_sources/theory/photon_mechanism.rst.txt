Formation of Gamma Spectrum
===========================


Gamma rays are high-energy photons. They are produced during the decay of radioactive isotopes.
And hence, it carries certain characteristic information about the decay process, and its spectrum can be used for nuclide identification and quantification.

The gamma spectrum is a plot of the number of gamma rays detected as a function of the energy of the gamma rays.
It is obtained by gamma-ray spectrometers, like HPGe detectors, NaI detectors, etc.

When a gamma-ray interacts with the materials, it can undergo various processes like photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production.
In the photoelectric absorption process, the photon energy is completely absorbed by the material, creating a characteristic peak in the gamma spectrum.
While in the Compton scattering process, the photon interacts with the electron and only loses some energy, and the scatters in a different direction.
This results in a continuous spectrum of gamma rays.

The key target of gamma spectrum analysis is to determine the energy and intensity of the photoelectric peaks, so as to identify the nuclides and quantify their activities.
